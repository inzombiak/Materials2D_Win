The devil looking enemy (Follower.lua) charges at the player if he/she is within range,
but if it steps on a red tile it "catches fire" and continues to run in the same direction. 
The barrels are explosive (Explosive.lua). In the next area when the switch (Trigger.lua) 
is stepped on the ball (RollingStone.lua) rolls and hits a wall (Breakable.lua), but it moves too slow to break it.
